'''Download turnover data (very ugly)-

Project:        BVM Data Science Cup 2017
Description:
    The `download_tu_data` method gets the turnover data for several product segments from the
    database. The SQL strings were provided as part of the task description.
    God knows why we hardcoded it here.
